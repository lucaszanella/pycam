# PyCam

Python app to visualize and record ONVIF cameras, with material theme support through QT, SOCKS support and other features. 

In development. Planned support is for Windows, Linux and OSX.

# How to use it (for now)

You're going to need docker. 

```
git clone https://github.com/lucaszanella/pycam
cd pycam/dev
./build.sh
./run.sh
```

You're going to enter a docker container. Now just run `./pycam.py` to launch the app. 

It's easier to use docker because all the dependencies will be cloned or installed and put in the right place for you to use.
